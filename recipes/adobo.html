        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>One of the best chicken dishes of all time. A very simple recipe with only a few ingredients and not much effort.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>8 pieces of Chicken, preferably bone-in</li>
          <li>20 Garlic Cloves</li>
          <li>300ml Unseasoned Rice Vinegar</li>
          <li>180ml Soy Sauce</li>
          <li>1 TBSP Black Peppercorns</li>
          <li>1 Bay Leaf</li>
          <li>120ml Water</li>
          <li>Rice to serve</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, add in all the chicken and the heavily crushed cloves of garlic. </li>
            <li>To that add a fresh crack of black pepper, black peppercorns, palm sugar, unseasoned rice vinegar, dark soy sauce, regular soy sauce, filtered water, and toss together and add in bay leaves. </li>
            <li>Cover with plastic wrap and marinate in the fridge for 2 hours, or ideally overnight. **Reserve all marinated liquid**</li>
            <li>Set a large braiser or dutch oven over medium-high heat and coat with oil to cover the pan. </li>
            <li>Sear all the chicken in batches on all sides for 2-3 minutes per side. Place each batch to the side once done browning to avoid overcrowding.</li>
            <li>Add marination to the pan (without the chicken) along with all the aromatics. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the chicken pieces to the pan in layers and bring to a boil. </li>
            <li>Once it reaches a boil, reduce the heat to low and let simmer (covered) for 35 minutes. Uncover and flip the chicken pieces, cover them again, and cook for another 25-35 more minutes. Turn chicken over occasionally to thoroughly coat and the sauce thickens and a glaze. </li>
            <li>Place the chicken on a plate of rice. Spoon on as much sauce as desired. </li>
        </ol>
